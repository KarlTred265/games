If the battleship game is a game where you as a player meet your computer where the rules and steps of the game consist of sinking each other's ships by choosing the right letter and number which then hits correctly or misses the opponent's ship, i.e. your daughter's ship grid which is 5x5 large .

when the round is finished, the game is over, you as a player have several times to hit the computer's ships and try to knock down all the computer's ships, if you knock out all the computer's ships before all the rounds are over, you have won, otherwise you have not won.

The game is then on and your first move is made where you see if you 
as a player have hit or missed your computer's ship.
